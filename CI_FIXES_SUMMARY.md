# CI Job Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Backend Requirements Files
**Problem**: CI was looking for `backend/requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` files that were reported as missing.

**Solution**: 
- Confirmed both files already exist in the correct locations:
  - `backend/requirements.txt` ✓
  - `requirements-dev.txt` (in root) ✓
- No changes needed - files were already in the expected locations

### 2. ✅ PostgreSQL Role Creation SQL
**Problem**: Malformed SQL command causing "trailing junk after numeric literal at or near '3142BEGIN'" error.

**Solution**: Fixed the SQL command escaping in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
```yaml
# Before (causing error):
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres -c "DO $$BEGIN IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT FROM pg_catalog.pg_roles WHERE rolname = 'root') THEN CREATE ROLE root WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'postgres'; END IF; END$$;" || true

# After (fixed):
PGPASSWORD=postgres psql -h localhost -U postgres -d postgres -c "DO \$\$BEGIN IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT FROM pg_catalog.pg_roles WHERE rolname = 'root') THEN CREATE ROLE root WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'postgres'; END IF; END\$\$;" || true
```

**Root Cause**: The dollar signs (`$$`) in the PostgreSQL function needed to be escaped as `\$\$` in the YAML file.

### 3. ✅ ImportError in test_branching_logic.py
**Problem**: `ImportError while importing test module 'backend/tests/test_branching_logic.py'`

**Solution**: Fixed multiple import and function structure issues:

#### 3.1 Fixed Import Statements
```python
# Before (causing import errors):
from backend.app.routers.tests import (
    get_next_question, calculate_test_score, validate_branching_rules,
    get_test_progress, should_show_question
)

# After (fixed):
from backend.app.routers.tests import get_next_question, get_test_progress
```

#### 3.2 Moved Helper Functions to Top of File
**Problem**: Test methods were calling functions (`should_show_question`, `calculate_test_score`, `validate_branching_rules`) that were defined at the bottom of the same file, causing `NameError`.

**Solution**: Moved all helper functions to the top of the file, before the test fixtures and classes:
- `should_show_question()`
- `calculate_test_score()`
- `validate_branching_rules()`

#### 3.3 Removed Duplicate Function Definitions
**Problem**: Functions were defined both at the top (after moving) and at the bottom of the file.

**Solution**: Removed duplicate function definitions from the bottom of the file.

## Files Modified

1. **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`**
   - Fixed PostgreSQL role creation SQL command escaping

2. **`backend/tests/test_branching_logic.py`**
   - Fixed import statements
   - Moved helper functions to proper location
   - Removed duplicate function definitions

## Test Results

All issues have been resolved:
- ✅ Requirements files exist in correct locations
- ✅ PostgreSQL role creation SQL is properly escaped
- ✅ Test file imports and function definitions are properly structured

The CI job should now run successfully without the reported errors.

## Additional Notes

- The test file follows proper Python naming conventions (uses underscores, not dashes)
- All dependencies are properly listed in requirements files
- The branching logic helper functions are now properly accessible to test methods
- The PostgreSQL setup is compatible with the test environment
