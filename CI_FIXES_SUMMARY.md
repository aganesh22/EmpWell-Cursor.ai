# CI Fixes Summary

## Recent Issues Fixed (Latest)

### Issue: Missing Dependencies Causing CI Failure

**Problem:** The CI workflow was failing due to missing Python packages that were being imported in the code but not declared in the requirements files.

**Error Messages:**
- `❌ Failed to import app: No module named 'google'`
- Security tools (bandit, safety) were being used but not installed

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Google Authentication**: The code in `backend/app/core/sso.py` imports from `google.oauth2`, `google.auth.transport`, and `google.auth.exceptions`, but the `google-auth` package was not in requirements.txt
2. **Microsoft Authentication**: The code imports `msal` for Azure SSO functionality, but `msal` was not in requirements.txt
3. **PDF Generation**: The code in `backend/app/routers/tests.py` imports `reportlab.lib.pagesizes` for PDF generation, but `reportlab` was not in requirements.txt
4. **Security Tools**: The CI workflow uses `bandit` and `safety` for security scanning, but these weren't in requirements-dev.txt

**Solution:**
Added the following dependencies to `backend/requirements.txt`:
- `google-auth==2.35.0` - Google Authentication Library for Python
- `msal==1.32.0` - Microsoft Authentication Library for Python
- `reportlab==4.2.5` - PDF generation library

Added the following dependencies to `requirements-dev.txt`:
- `bandit==1.7.5` - Security linter for Python
- `safety==2.3.5` - Vulnerability scanner for Python dependencies

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `backend/requirements.txt` - Added missing runtime dependencies
- ✅ `requirements-dev.txt` - Added missing development/security dependencies

**Expected Result:**
- CI should now successfully install all required dependencies
- The import error for `google` module should be resolved
- Security scanning tools should be available in the CI environment
- The application should be able to import and use Google SSO, Microsoft SSO, and PDF generation functionality

## Previous Issues Fixed

### Issue: Database Connection and Requirements Files

**Problem:** The CI workflow was failing due to multiple issues including missing requirements files and database connection problems.

**Error Messages:**
- `❌ backend/requirements.txt not found`
- `❌ requirements-dev.txt not found`  
- `FATAL: role "root" does not exist`

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Missing Requirements Files**: The GitHub Actions workflow expected requirements files that didn't exist
2. **Database Role Issue**: The PostgreSQL connection was trying to use a 'root' user that doesn't exist by default
3. **Path Issues**: The CI workflow was looking for files in the wrong locations

**Solution:**
1. **Created Requirements Files**: 
   - Created `backend/requirements.txt` with all necessary Python dependencies
   - Created `requirements-dev.txt` with development and testing dependencies

2. **Fixed Database Configuration**:
   - Updated the CI workflow to use the correct PostgreSQL user (`postgres`)
   - Set proper environment variables for database connection
   - Added proper database initialization steps

3. **Updated CI Workflow**:
   - Fixed file paths to point to the correct locations
   - Added proper error handling and validation
   - Improved debugging output for easier troubleshooting

**Files Modified:**
- ✅ `backend/requirements.txt` - Created with core dependencies
- ✅ `requirements-dev.txt` - Created with development dependencies
- ✅ `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Updated database configuration and file paths

**Expected Result:**
- CI should find and install all required dependencies
- Database connection should work properly with the postgres user
- Tests should run successfully in the CI environment

## Key Learnings

1. **Dependency Management**: Always ensure that all imported packages are declared in requirements files
2. **Security Tools**: Include security scanning tools in development requirements for CI workflows
3. **Database Configuration**: Use standard database users and proper connection strings in CI
4. **Error Debugging**: Comprehensive error messages help identify root causes quickly
5. **Version Pinning**: Pin dependency versions to ensure reproducible builds

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor CI**: Watch for any remaining issues after these fixes
2. **Test Locally**: Verify that the application works with the new dependencies
3. **Update Documentation**: Document the new dependencies and their purposes
4. **Security Review**: Ensure all security tools are properly configured and running
