## ðŸ”¬ Technical Implementation

### Core Algorithm
```python
def calculate_personality_type(responses: List[int]) -> PersonalityResult:
    # Convert 1-5 responses to preference strengths (-2 to +2)
    # Calculate dimension scores for each E/I, S/N, T/F, J/P
    # Determine preferences and confidence levels
    # Generate comprehensive personality profile
```

### Scoring Logic
- **Response Conversion**: 1-5 scale â†’ -2 to +2 preference strength
- **Dimension Scoring**: Sum of preference strengths per dimension
- **Type Determination**: Highest preference in each dimension
- **Confidence Calculation**: Absolute preference strength / maximum possible

### Database Integration
- **TestTemplate**: Creates database template for personality test
- **Questions**: Stores all 60 questions with metadata
- **Responses**: Tracks user responses and results
- **Attempts**: Full test attempt tracking with personality type results
