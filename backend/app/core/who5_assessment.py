"""
WHO-5 Wellbeing Index Implementation.

This module provides a comprehensive WHO-5 (WHO-Five Well-Being Index) assessment 
that measures current mental wellbeing over the past two weeks.

The WHO-5 is a short questionnaire consisting of 5 simple and non-invasive questions,
which tap into subjective wellbeing. It has been found to have adequate validity both
as a screening tool for depression and as an outcome measure in clinical trials.
