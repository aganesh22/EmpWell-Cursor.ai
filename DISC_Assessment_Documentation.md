# DISC Assessment Implementation

## Overview

The DISC Assessment is a comprehensive behavioral assessment tool that measures four primary behavioral dimensions: **Dominance**, **Influence**, **Steadiness**, and **Conscientiousness**. This implementation provides a complete solution for administering, scoring, and interpreting DISC assessments in workplace settings.

## Theoretical Foundation

The DISC model is based on the work of William Moulton Marston and measures how individuals respond to:

- **Dominance (D)**: How you respond to problems and challenges
- **Influence (I)**: How you influence others to your point of view
- **Steadiness (S)**: How you respond to the pace of the environment
- **Conscientiousness (C)**: How you respond to rules and procedures

## Implementation Features

### Core Components

1. **Question Bank**: 28 carefully crafted question groups with 4 words each
2. **Scoring Algorithm**: Weighted scoring system with dimension-specific calculations
3. **Profile Interpretation**: Comprehensive analysis including strengths, challenges, and workplace insights
4. **API Integration**: RESTful endpoints for seamless integration
5. **Data Validation**: Robust validation for response integrity

### Assessment Structure

- **Format**: Forced-choice questions
- **Questions**: 28 question groups
- **Response Type**: Select one word that MOST describes you and one that LEAST describes you
- **Administration Time**: 8-12 minutes
- **Scoring Method**: Weighted selection with dimension-specific weights

### Response Processing
1. **Word Selection**: Participants select words that MOST and LEAST describe them
2. **Weighted Scoring**: Each word has a dimension and weight (0.6-1.0)
3. **Dimension Calculation**: 
   - Add full weight for "most" selections
   - Subtract half weight for "least" selections
4. **Percentage Conversion**: Convert raw scores to percentages
5. **Profile Determination**: Identify primary and secondary styles

### Intensity Levels
- **High**: Primary dimension > 40%
- **Moderate**: Primary dimension 30-40%
- **Low**: Primary dimension < 30%

## Integration Guide

### Backend Integration
```python
from backend.app.core.disc_assessment import DISCAssessment, calculate_disc_profile

# Calculate profile
result = calculate_disc_profile(most_responses, least_responses)

# Access results
print(f"Primary Style: {result.primary_style}")
print(f"Strengths: {result.strengths}")
```

### Database Schema
The assessment integrates with the existing test framework:
- **TestTemplate**: Stores assessment metadata
- **TestAttempt**: Records completion and basic results
- **Response**: Stores individual question responses

### Validation
- Response count validation (exactly 28 responses)
- Value range validation (0-3 for each response)
- Uniqueness validation (most â‰  least for each question)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
# Example responses favoring Dominance
most_responses = [0, 1, 2, 3] * 7  # 28 responses
least_responses = [3, 2, 1, 0] * 7  # 28 responses

result = DISCAssessment.calculate_disc_profile(most_responses, least_responses)
print(f"Profile: {result.profile_type}")
print(f"Primary: {result.primary_style}")
print(f"Strengths: {result.strengths}")
```

### API Usage
```javascript
// Submit assessment
const response = await fetch('/disc/submit', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    most_responses: mostResponses,
    least_responses: leastResponses
  })
});

const result = await response.json();
console.log('DISC Profile:', result.profile_type);
